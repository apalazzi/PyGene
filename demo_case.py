"""
demo that tries to show one reason why genetic algorithms are successful.

It tries to crack open a suitcase with a few locks, each with 1-5
digits.  Fitness function can only determine that the lock is open, not
the progress of opening the lock (how much the lock is opened)

Genetic algorithm can keep partial results (e.g. 1 lock open) while
trying other locks.

In general each lock represents a partial solution to the problem
described by organism.
