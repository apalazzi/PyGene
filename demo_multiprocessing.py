"""
Parallel fitness calculation using the Python multiprocessing library.

Based on demo_string.py, but using a pool of 4 worker processes to do the fitness calculation.

Note: the fitness calculation for this GA problem is not very computationally expensive,
so the worker processes don't look very busy. However, if you add some extra CPU-intensive calculations
to the calculate_fitness() function, you'll notice the difference.
